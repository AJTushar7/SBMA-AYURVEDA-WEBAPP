I want to create a modern UI webapp for my ayurvedic brand SBMA. I liked the website https://balanceayurveda.in/, its UI, its sections, So i want to create exact/clone like this but change theme use light green/white.  My webapps should be in angular framework, no backend, server services to be used. Create Mock data of products in the angular app and use that, so no calling of api in my webapps.

Features to be in my webapps:
1) Modern UI Homepage exact like https://balanceayurveda.in/.
2) Copy its homepage, its headers, its carousel(When website in on top then header have transaprent background it have the slider images background color , but when scroll down then header sticks to top with white sleek background).
